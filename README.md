# TwitterBlocker
Block (or mute) everyone who retweeted a particular tweet, everyone who follows a certain account, or everyone on a Twitter list.

Script originally created by the owner of [Outside the Asylum](https://outsidetheasylum.blog/twitter-blocker/).

I've simply uncompressed (unminified) it and added some comments. I may add some more features. If it breaks, I'll attempt to fix it, though my JS skills are not as good as other languages.

## Note
It's worth remembering that not everyone who follows an account agrees with them - but you can make your own decisions.
